Integrating 42 CLI into your GitHub repository workflow is a straightforward process. By using GitHub Actions, you can automate the build, lint, and test processes with each push or pull request. Below is an example GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that you can use as a starting point:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  ci:
    name: CI
    timeout-minutes: 5
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Install GCC and Make
      - name: Install GCC and Make dependencies
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update -qq
          sudo apt-get install -y -qq gcc make

      # Step 3: Install Rust
      - name: Install Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          profile: minimal
          toolchain: stable
          override: true

      # Step 4: Install Python
      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9

      # Step 5: Install sccache
      - name: Install sccache
        uses: mozilla-actions/sccache-action@v0.0.3
        with:
          token: ${{ github.token }}

      # Step 6: Install 42 CLI
      - name: Install 42 CLI
        run: cargo install ftcli
        env:
          SCCACHE_GHA_ENABLED: "true"
          RUSTC_WRAPPER: "sccache"
          CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI: "true"

      # Step 7: Install Norminette
      - name: Install Norminette
        run: |
          python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
          pip install norminette

      # Step 8: Build the project
      - name: Build
        run: ftcli build

      # Step 9: Clean the project
      - name: Clean
        run: ftcli clean

      # Step 10: Lint the code
      - name: Lint
        run: ftcli lint
```

This workflow covers essential steps, including setting up the Rust and Python environments, installing necessary tools and dependencies, and executing build, clean, and lint commands using 42 CLI. Customise it based on your project's specific requirements. For further details and customisation options, for projects which include the MLX or the CPP modules, refer to the [42 CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/herbievine/42-cli).

## Practical Examples

In this section, we'll delve into practical examples showcasing the versatility of 42 CLI. From project management to testing suites, these real-world scenarios will demonstrate how 42 CLI becomes an indispensable tool in your development arsenal.

### Project Management Made Easy

Let's start with a fundamental use case: managing the build, run, clean, and lint processes in your projects. The `42-cli.toml` configuration file is the linchpin for orchestrating these tasks.

```toml
name = "so_long"

[scripts]
build = { cmd = "make", mlx = true, mlx_dir = "minilibx" }
run= [{ cmd = "./so_long maps/small.ber" }]
clean = { cmd = "make fclean", mlx = true, mlx_dir = "minilibx" }
lint = { cmd = "norminette ." }
```

- **Build Script**: Defines the build process using `make`, and optionally installs MLX in the specified directory.
- **Run Script**: Executes the project, running additional build steps if specified.
- **Clean Script**: Cleans up project artifacts, including optional MLX cleanup.
- **Lint Script**: Runs Norminette for code linting.

### Running Tests

For projects with extensive testing suites, 42 CLI seamlessly integrates into your testing workflow. In this example with `ft_printf`, the `test` script automates the testing process.

```toml
name = "ft_printf"

[scripts]
build = { cmd = "make" }
test = [
  { cmd = "git clone https://github.com/Tripouille/printfTester.git tester" },
  { cmd = "make m", dir = "tester" },
  { cmd = "rm -rf tester" }
]
clean = { cmd = "make fclean" }
lint = { cmd = "norminette ." }
```

- **Test Script**: Automates the testing process using the `printfTester` suite.
- **Sequential Execution**: The test script executes build and clean scripts sequentially.

### Cross-Project Automation

To automate deployments or run commands across multiple projects effortlessly, you should have a project structure like this:

```
42/
â”œâ”€ libft/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 42-cli.toml
â”œâ”€ ft_printf/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 42-cli.toml
â”œâ”€ get_next_line/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 42-cli.toml
â”œâ”€ 42-cli.toml
```

Then in your root `42-cli.toml`, reference all your projects:

```toml
name = "42"
projects = [ "libft", "ft_printf", "get_next_line" ]

[scripts]
```

- **Centralized Commands**: Execute commands simultaneously across listed projects.
- **Skip Absent Projects**: Projects not containing a `42-cli.toml` file are gracefully skipped.
