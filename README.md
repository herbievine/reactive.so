# reactive.so

Welcome to **Reactive**! This project is aimed at supporting students who may not have regular access to campus facilities or the peer-to-peer learning experiences that many students benefit from. Reactive provides a platform where students can access educational content, share their own insights, and collaborate with others.

## About the Project

reactive.so was created with the goal of making educational content more accessible to students who face challenges in participating in traditional campus-based learning. By fostering a community-driven platform, students can learn from each other, share knowledge, and grow together.
