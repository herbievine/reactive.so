If you stumbled upon this article, youâ€™re probably wondering what Bun is. Youâ€™re in luck, as Iâ€™m about to tell you everything there is to know about Bun.

So what is Bun? Essentially, itâ€™s a new JS runtime, similar to Node. Unlike Node, however, Bun is insanely fast. Like seriously, seriously fast. Weâ€™ll look at that later though, letâ€™s first look at the existing problem with Node.

## Whatâ€™s wrong with Node?

Node has been around since 2009. Since then, the web and server ecosystem has vastly changed. Many of Nodeâ€™s issues have been covered by the creator, Ryan Dahl ([in this conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA)). A quick TL;DR is that Node doesnâ€™t support built-in TypeScript, JSX, or Environment Variables. Moreover, its package manager, NPM, is famous for the `node_modules` folder of doom.

## How is it so fast?

Bun is built with Zig, a low-level programming language with manual memory management. It uses the JavaScriptCore Engine, which tends to be a little more performant than Googleâ€™s V8 Engine.

Bun mostly accredits its speed to Zig, stating the following on their [website](https://bun.sh/):

> Zigâ€™s low-level control over memory and lack of hidden control flow makes it much simpler to write fast software.

## Benchmarks

Jarred Sumner, has made numerous benchmarks on Twitter regarding the speed of Bun compared to Node and Deno. Below, Iâ€™m going to be running some tests locally to see if Bun really stands up to these other runtimes. In each test, the script will simply save a text file locally. Iâ€™m using Mitata to test the speed.

### Testing Bun

```jsx
// ./scripts/bun.js

import { write } from "bun";
import { bench, run } from "mitata";

const file = "./out/bun.txt";

bench("bun:write", async () => {
  await write(file, "hello world");
});

await run();
```

```bash
âžœ  bench bun ./scripts/bun.js
cpu: Apple M1
runtime: bun 0.1.6 (arm64-darwin)

benchmark      time (avg)             (min â€¦ max)       p75       p99      p995
------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------
bun:write   76.86 Âµs/iter    (64.79 Âµs â€¦ 2.35 ms)   75.5 Âµs 139.38 Âµs 246.17 Âµs
```

### Testing Node

```jsx
// ./scripts/node.mjs

import { writeFileSync } from "fs";
import { bench, run } from "mitata";

const file = "./out/node.txt";

bench("node:write", async () => {
  writeFileSync(file, "hello world");
});

await run();
```

```bash
âžœ  bench node ./scripts/node.mjs
cpu: Apple M1
runtime: node v18.7.0 (arm64-darwin)

benchmark       time (avg)             (min â€¦ max)       p75       p99      p995
-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------
node:write   94.55 Âµs/iter   (65.92 Âµs â€¦ 29.59 ms)  78.29 Âµs 129.25 Âµs 217.13 Âµs
```

### Testing Deno

```jsx
// ./scripts/deno.mjs

import { bench, run } from "https://esm.run/mitata";

const file = "./out/deno.txt";

bench("deno:write", async () => {
  Deno.writeTextFileSync(file, "hello world");
});

await run();
```

```bash
âžœ  bench deno run -A ./scripts/deno.mjs
Download https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fs/+esm
cpu: Apple M1
runtime: deno 1.24.2 (aarch64-apple-darwin)

benchmark       time (avg)             (min â€¦ max)       p75       p99      p995
-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------
deno:write  110.66 Âµs/iter    (74.25 Âµs â€¦ 5.88 ms) 129.79 Âµs 162.33 Âµs 179.75 Âµs
```

On all three occasions, a file was written to storage. Below is a table containing the runtime used, the native API used, and the final speed.

| Runtime | API                    | Average Speed |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| Bun     | Bun.write()            | 76.86Âµs       |
| Node    | fs.writeFileSync       | 94.55Âµs       |
| Deno    | Deno.writeTextFileSync | 110.66Âµs      |

As you can see, Bun is clearly ahead of Node and Deno in terms of server-side operations. I say server-side operation, as Bun doesn't fare as well when using client-side operations. In an upcoming post, Iâ€™ll be comparing Bun + Next.js against Deno + Fresh.

## Caveats

Bun is still in development. What youâ€™ve seen in this post may be irrelevant in a few months. Just keep that in mind. Head over to [their roadmap on Github](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/159), and youâ€™ll see that only 17/133 tasks have been completed (as of writing this). So clearly the project is still in its infancy and needs many years of development before it can be used in a production environment. That being said, itâ€™s a promising project that should see wide adoption once it can replace tools such as Node.

Anyway, I hope you found this article helpful ðŸ˜„
