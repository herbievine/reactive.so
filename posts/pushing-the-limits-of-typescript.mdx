I often get stuck with TypeScript, and when I do, I want to throw my Mac out of the window. So Iâ€™ve created this article, to help you and I write better code. Iâ€™ll be updating this post when I stumbled upon new and useful TypeScript hacks. In the meantime, feel free to get inspired to create your own cool TS magic, or just steal some code, I wonâ€™t judgeâ€¦ ðŸ˜œ

## First index of array

You might want to get the type of the first index in an array, and if so, this utility type is for you.

```tsx
type First<T extends any[]> = T extends [infer P, ...any[]] ? P : never;
```

Itâ€™s a rather simple utility type to help you infer the type of the first index of an array.

```tsx
type Test1 = First<[() => string, "a", "b"]>;
//   ^ Test1: () => string

type Test2 = First<[undefined, 4]>;
//   ^ Test2: undefined

type Test3 = First<[]>;
//   ^ Test3: never
```

If youâ€™d like to use a variable of type tuple, youâ€™ll be better off using the bracket notation to access the first element of the array, like this: `T[0]`.

```tsx
type First<T extends readonly any[]> = T[0];
```

And then pass the `typeof` your tuple.

```tsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] as const;

type Test = First<typeof numbers>;
//   ^ Test: () => 1
```

**Note**: remember to cast your array as a const, using `as const`, TypeScript will then infer it as `readonly [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

## Infer the type of each element when using map()

Letâ€™s say you have an array of vowels, or `string[]`. Now, letâ€™s say you want to loop over the array using `Array.map()`. You would have something like this:

```tsx
const vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];

vowels.map((v: string) => {});
//          ^ v: string
```

An easy, yet underused approach is to cast the array to a tuple using `as const`. Doing so will allow `Array.map()` to return the possible values obtainable by `Array.map()`. So now, your code should lok something like this.

```tsx
const vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] as const;

vowels.map((v) => {});
//          ^ v: "a" | "e" | "i" | "o" | "u"
```

Casting your array as a `const` does come with a drawback, however. You wonâ€™t be able to mutate it after the fact. That means no more `Array.push()`, `Array.pop()`, etcâ€¦

## Getting the length of a tuple

TypeScript is really clever, as it lets us access the prototype of an element. So instead of regular JS, where we use `Array.length`, for TS Types, we can use `any[]['length]` to access the length. And if that array turns out to be a tuple, TS can directly infer the length!

```tsx
type Length<T extends readonly any[]> = T["length"];
```

Using it is simple, either pass a tuple directly into the typeâ€¦

```tsx
type Test1 = Length<["a", "b", "c"]>;
//   ^ Test1: 3
```

Or, a more practical approach is to pass a variable of type tupleâ€¦

```tsx
const letters = ["a", "b", "c"] as const;

type Test2 = Length<typeof letters>;
//   ^ Test2: 3
```

**Reminder**: the above method only works with variables of type tuple, so arrays unfortunately will not workâ€¦

## Conclusion

Thatâ€™s it! I hope this helped someone out there. Iâ€™ll be updating this post when I stumble upon some other fancy TS trick. In the meantime, you can check out <Link href="/post/whats-the-deal-with-bun">this post</Link> which Iâ€™ll link here. Itâ€™s worth the read; I promise.
