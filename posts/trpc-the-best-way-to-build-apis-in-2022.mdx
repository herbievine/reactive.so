We all know the hassle of building APIs. You install Express, or Nest if you‚Äôre developing for a big project, maybe GraphQL, and then you have to make everything yourself. From relational mapping to TypeScript support across your server and client. But what if I told you there was an all-in-one solution for that?

Too good to be true you might be thinking; well I‚Äôm writing this to tell you it‚Äôs not.

## What is tRPC anyway?

tRPC is essentially just a way to call code. Think of it like an API endpoint, but the tRPC lingo is a `procedure`.

‚ÄúSo we can create API with this new tool; what‚Äôs different?‚Äù

tRPC isn‚Äôt just a way to create procedures, it has much more under the hood.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast - No code generation or run-time bloat
- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Typesafe - From DB to client
- ‚úÖ Safe - Input and output validation with Zod
- üçÉ Light - tRPC has zero deps (@trpc/client@9.27.0 is only 4.9kb gzipped)
- üîã Batteries included - Available for React, Next, Express and Fastify (can be used with Nuxt & SvelteKit but API may not be complete)
- ‚õë React Query support - All queries, mutations and subscriptions use React Query

## How does it compare?

### REST

The caveat with REST is the lack of standardization. Simply put, REST is an architectural style of mapping URL paths to entities, and then exposing different HTTP methods to get or mutate said entities.

This approach is intuitive to most developers but it lacks standardization across the server and the client. Think of it as an imaginary obscured line between both parties. Not great for DX‚Ä¶

### GraphQL

GraphQL on the other hand is standardized and was made for the exact problem cited above. It removes the line between server and client and provides an exact schema of what the server is intending to respond with.

The caveats however are the fact you have to learn GraphQL syntax and there‚Äôs a lot of overhead when setting up a project.

## A look at some code

### Defining a procedure

First of all, it‚Äôs best to define the schemas. In my case, I‚Äôll be querying [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/), which is using REST, so I‚Äôll manually define the expected response using [Zod](https://zod.dev).

```tsx
const pokemonSchema = z.object({
  count: z.number(),
  next: z.string().nullish(),
  previous: z.string().nullish(),
  results: z.array(
    z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      url: z.string(),
    })
  ),
});
```

Then we can define a procedure to fetch pokemon, with an offset input for pagination.

```tsx
export const pokemonRouter = createRouter().query("findAll", {
  // Create input schema
  input: z.object({
    offset: z.number(),
  }),
  async resolve({ input }) {
    const res = await (
      await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=${input.offset}`)
    ).json();

    // Validate the response
    return pokemonSchema.parse(res);
  },
});
```

In the above example, if the input or output criteria are not met, an error is thrown. All in just 30 lines of code!

We then have to link the `pokemonRouter` to the main router. This is also done with the tRPC function `createRoute`, and can be easily added with `.merge()`.

```tsx
import { pokemonRouter } from "./pokemon";

export const appRouter = createRouter()
  .transformer(superjson)
  .merge("pokemon.", pokemonRouter);

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

As you can see, we‚Äôre exporting the type of `appRouter`, we need to do this so TypeScript can infer our procedures, and for autocomplete! We can easily create hooks to call our code with the line below (this is only necessary if using in Next or React):

```tsx
export const trpc = createReactQueryHooks<AppRouter>();
```

We can then consume the data in a component like so:

```tsx
const Home: NextPage = () => {
  // ...

  const { data, refetch } = trpc.useQuery(["pokemon.findAll", { offset }]);

  // ...
};
```

In my case, as I added pagination, I‚Äôve got some extra functionality to make it work. As most of that stuff is React Query, I won‚Äôt include it here, but feel free to check out the [source code here](https://github.com/reactive-so/trpc-demo).

## Thoughts

Overall, I strongly believe that tRPC is here to stay. As more and more businesses adopt this technology, we are going to see a stronger ecosystem and wider support across front-end and back-end frameworks.

If you want to give it a go, you can head over to their [website](https://trpc.io/) to check out more about it.

Hope this helped üòÉ
