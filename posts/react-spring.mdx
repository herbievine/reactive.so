# react-spring
### A spring-physics first animation library giving you flexible tools to confidently cast your ideas

`react-spring` is a cross-platform spring-physics first animation library.

It's as simple as:

```jsx
const styles = useSpring({
  from: {
    opacity: 0
  },
  to: {
    opacity: 1
  }
})

<animated.div style={styles} />
```

Just a small bit about us:

- **Cross-Platform**: We support `react-dom`, `react-native`, `react-three-fiber`, `react-konva` & `react-zdog`.
- **Versatile**: Be declarative with your animations or if you prefer, imperative.
- **Spring-Physics First**: By default animation use springs for fluid interactivity, but we support durations with easings as well.

There's a lot more to be had! Give it a try and find out.

## Getting Started

### ⚡️ Jump Start

```shell
# Install the entire library
npm install react-spring
# or just install your specific target (recommended)
npm install @react-spring/web
```

```jsx
import { animated, useSpring } from '@react-spring/web'

const FadeIn = ({ isVisible, children }) => {
  const styles = useSpring({
    opacity: isVisible ? 1 : 0,
    y: isVisible ? 0 : 24,
  })

  return <animated.div style={styles}>{children}</animated.div>
}
```

It's as simple as that to create scroll-in animations when value of `isVisible` is toggled.
